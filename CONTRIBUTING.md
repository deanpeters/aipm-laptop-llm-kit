# Contributing to AIPM Laptop LLM Kit

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document outlines how to contribute to the project.

## üéØ Project Goals

This toolkit aims to provide a **one-command local AI stack** for Product Managers and professionals who want:
- Complete privacy and offline operation
- Zero recurring costs after hardware investment
- Easy setup without deep technical knowledge
- Integration between AI tools (LM Studio, n8n, LangFlow, VS Code)

## üîß Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aipm-laptop-llm-kit.git
   cd aipm-laptop-llm-kit
   ```

2. **Test the installation**
   ```bash
   ./install.sh --dry-run    # Safe test without changes
   ./install.sh              # Full installation
   ```

## üìã Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

**Shell Scripts (`.sh` files):**
- Must pass `shellcheck` linting
- Use `#!/bin/bash` shebang
- Include error handling with `set -e` where appropriate
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic

**PowerShell Scripts (`.ps1` files):**
- Must pass `PSScriptAnalyzer` linting
- Use approved PowerShell verbs
- Include proper error handling
- Use descriptive parameter names

**Documentation:**
- Use `~~~` for code blocks (not ```)
- Keep language simple and beginner-friendly
- Include examples for each major feature
- Update relevant documentation when changing functionality

### Testing Requirements

Before submitting a PR:

1. **Lint your code:**
   ```bash
   # Shell scripts
   shellcheck install.sh scripts/*.sh
   
   # PowerShell scripts  
   pwsh -Command "Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer *.ps1 scripts/*.ps1"
   ```

2. **Test installation:**
   ```bash
   # Dry run (safe)
   ./install.sh --dry-run
   
   # Full installation (on clean system if possible)
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Test idempotency:**
   ```bash
   # Run multiple times - should be safe
   ./install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
- `feat: add LangFlow scheduling support`
- `fix: resolve Docker port conflict detection`
- `docs: update offline architecture guide`
- `refactor: improve error handling in setup-env.sh`
