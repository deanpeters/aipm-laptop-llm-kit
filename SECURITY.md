# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security by Design

The AIPM Laptop LLM Kit is designed with security and privacy as core principles:

### Local-First Architecture
- **No external API calls** during normal operation (except for software downloads during installation)
- **All AI inference** happens locally on your machine
- **No data transmission** to third-party services
- **Complete offline operation** after setup

### Data Privacy
- **Your documents stay local**: AnythingLLM and all AI processing happens on your machine
- **No telemetry**: No usage tracking or analytics sent anywhere
- **No cloud dependencies**: AI models run entirely offline
- **Local storage only**: All configurations and data stored in your local filesystem

### Network Security
- **Minimal attack surface**: Only local services running on localhost
- **Container isolation**: Docker containers provide process isolation
- **No external ports**: Services only bind to localhost interfaces
- **Firewall friendly**: No inbound connections required

## üîí What We DON'T Do

To maintain security and privacy:
- ‚ùå **No cloud API keys required** for core functionality
- ‚ùå **No external model downloads** during runtime (only during setup)
- ‚ùå **No automatic updates** that could compromise your setup
- ‚ùå **No network calls** from your documents or conversations
- ‚ùå **No telemetry or analytics** collection

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

### For High-Severity Issues:
- **Email**: [Your security email here]
- **Subject**: "SECURITY: AIPM LLM Kit Vulnerability Report"
- **Include**: Detailed description, reproduction steps, potential impact

### For Lower-Severity Issues:
- **GitHub Issues**: Use the security issue template
- **Label**: Apply "security" label to the issue

### What to Include:
1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** and attack scenarios
4. **Suggested fixes** if you have them
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up

## ‚ö° Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix development**: Depends on severity (hours to weeks)
- **Public disclosure**: After fix is available and tested

## üîç Security Best Practices

When using this toolkit:

### Installation Security
- **Download verification**: Only clone from official GitHub repository
- **Script inspection**: Review scripts before running with elevated privileges
- **Isolated testing**: Test on non-critical systems first

### Operational Security
- **Network isolation**: Consider running on isolated network if handling sensitive data
- **Access controls**: Restrict access to the installation directory
- **Regular updates**: Update Docker images and dependencies regularly
- **Backup strategy**: Maintain secure backups of your configurations

### Docker Security
- **Container scanning**: Regularly update base images for security patches
- **Volume permissions**: Ensure storage volumes have appropriate permissions
- **Network policies**: Use Docker's built-in network isolation

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Configuration

### Recommended Hardening:
1. **Firewall rules**: Block unnecessary outbound connections
2. **File permissions**: Restrict access to configuration files
3. **User accounts**: Run with minimal required privileges
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor local service logs for unusual activity

### Environment Variables:
- **Never commit secrets**: Use `.env.local` for sensitive values
- **Rotate keys**: Change any placeholder API keys to unique values
- **Secure storage**: Protect `.env` files with appropriate permissions

## üìã Security Checklist

Before using in production or with sensitive data:

- [ ] Reviewed all installation scripts
- [ ] Verified Docker image sources
- [ ] Configured appropriate firewall rules
- [ ] Set secure file permissions
- [ ] Tested offline operation
- [ ] Confirmed no external data transmission
- [ ] Established backup procedures
- [ ] Documented security configurations

## üéØ Threat Model

This toolkit is designed to protect against:
- **Data exfiltration**: All processing stays local
- **Vendor lock-in**: Open source, self-hosted stack
- **Service outages**: Fully offline operation
- **Cost escalation**: No recurring subscription fees
- **Privacy violations**: No external data sharing

## üìû Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:
- **General security questions**: Open a GitHub issue with "security" label
- **Vulnerability reports**: Follow responsible disclosure process above
- **Security discussions**: Join community discussions in issues
